### Summary

BusMall Inc. Requires an web based catalog of assorted high-markup products provided to a captive audience seeking a mental escape from the drudgery of travel.  Purpose of this project is for market analysis on proposed products to test their potential customer interest before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in motion.

1. **As a Focus Group Participants using the catalog, I want to choose a product from list of 3 product images displayed on screen so that I can see what my most favorite product is in comparison to all the availble products I've looked through within the catalog.**

2. **As a Margeting Resarch Team, I want to know the total number of clicks for a product chosen by the Focus Group Participants and a percentage of times that an item was clicked when presented as a choice.**

2. **As a developer, I want to randomly display set of 3 product images to the user, allow the user to pick from the 3, then provide result of most picked product image for that user.**
2a. **As a developer, randomly displayed images cannot be duplicates per cycle, and cannot be used withing the next following cycle.**
2b. **As a developer, I want to capture the total amount of product images displayed, then provide percentage of times that image was clicked by the user when displayed.**

### Description

We’re using the following template to create user stories. 

Since we have mentioned the type of user, the user story can refer to it with “I”.
This is useful for **consistency** and to **avoid repetition** in the Acceptance criteria.
It’s also good to practice a little **empathy**.

For example:

```markdown
1. I click on the “submit” button.
1. A modal window appears if I don’t have enough credits.
1. The modal window contains the following:
  1. […]
```

The template uses [markdown][2].
You should get familiar with it if you’re not already, **it’s awesome!**

### Template

```markdown
[
The user story should have a reason to exist: what do I need as the user described in the summary?
This part details any detail that could not be passed by the summary.
]


### Acceptance Criteria

1. [If I do A.]
1. [B should happen.]

[
Also, here are a few points that need to be addressed:

1. Constraint 1;
1. Constraint 2;
1. Constraint 3.
]


### Resources:

* Mockups: [Here goes a URL to or the name of the mockup(s) in inVision];
* Testing URL: [Here goes a URL to the testing branch or IP];
* Staging URL: [Here goes a URL to the feature on staging];


### Notes

[Some complementary notes if necessary:]

* > Here goes a quote from an email
* Here goes whatever useful information can exist…
```

### Example

```markdown
**As a** a member of [the development team](http://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#team-dev),
**I want** clear context and goals **so that** I can work efficiently.

Scattering information in emails and other places makes it difficult to work collaboratively,
so I need all the relevant information within the relevant issue.


### Acceptance Criteria

1. I have clear Acceptance criteria [what a beautiful recursion].
1. I have to understand the logic of the mockups, more than the pixels used, so that we can optimize the code.

Please also note:

1. If a conversation about the issue I’m working on is happening,
the outcomes should be documented within that issue (not in the comments).
